# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. It restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a way to access that instance from any point in the application.


## Key Features:

-Single Instance: Guarantees that a class has only one instance.
-Global Access: Provides a global point of access to the instance.
-Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only if it is requested for the first time.
-Thread Safety: Ensures safe access in multi-threaded environments, if implemented accordingly.


## Usage Guidelines:

-Shared Resources: Suitable for managing shared resources like configuration settings, database connections, or logging mechanisms.
-Centralized Control: Facilitates centralized control and coordination in scenarios where a single point of control is beneficial.
